# AviatifeScripts

You can run these scripts directly in your browser's console, but if you want to automate the execution every time you enter the page, use an extension like Tampermonkey.

If you use tampermonkey, go to the Aviatife page where you want the script to run, click on the tampermonkey extension and "create a new script". Then copy and paste the corresponding code and save. It should activate and run automatically when you refresh the page
